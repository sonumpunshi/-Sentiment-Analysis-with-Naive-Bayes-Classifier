Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes ClassifierSentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes Classifier
Developed a Naive Bayes classifier to predict customer sentiment (positive or negative) from product reviews.

Trained the model on a given dataset, calculating prior probabilities and conditional probabilities of words within each class.

Tested the model on a separate dataset and evaluated performance, achieving an accuracy of 86%.

Applied the model to predict the sentiment of four specific reviews, demonstrating the classifier's capability in real-world scenarios.

Created a program to determine and apply either logistic or linear regression based on the data inputted.

Utilized the logistic regression model to predict customer complaint resolution time based on complaint type and details.

Employed the linear regression model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate during exercise.

Provided a detailed report including estimated model parameters and cost function graphs for each predictive model.
